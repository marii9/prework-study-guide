# prework-study-guides webpage


## Description: The motivation for the prework-study-guides webpage was purposely for the knowledge of coding and the basics so i can further excel into this field. The reason for building the prework-study-guides webpage is because of the experience and testing my knowledge on coding and putting it into a real live website. Creating the webpage solved many issues but mainly the time management and creativity that you can put into creating a website. Creating this webpage has taught me many things such as how HTMl, CSS, and Javascript all interact with one another to create a personal experience for the user.

## Usage: This Prework Study Guide can be used in many ways. For example, each section is filled with a topic which contains, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. All of the topics listed have notes that express features that are unique to each of them. Also if we open the DevTools console you will see JavaScript running. Which it list the topics that we learned from the prework, and it chooses one topic for us to study first. If you keep looking in the DevTools console in the elements section you will also see the different type of CSS that we have used for the variations of the websites such as, the margin and padding involved within the block.
